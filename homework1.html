                      <li>We're making mini peanut butter cups today, so start out by lining a 24-cup mini muffin pan with mini muffin liners.</li>
                      <li>Melt your chocolate chips together with a few tablespoons of coconut oil.</li>
                      <li>Into each liner, spoon a teaspoon or so of melted chocolate, and spread it up the sides of the muffin liner as high up as you can. Freeze your pan for about 5 minutes</li>             
                      <li>While pan is in the freezer, stir coconut oil into your peanut butter until completely blended.</li>
                      <li>Remove pan from freezer and divide the peanut butter mixture between your chocolate shells.</li>
                      <li>Divide remaining melted chocolate between all of the peanut butter-filled muffin cups. Use the back of spoon to lightly spread the chocolate towards edge of each wrapper, if necessary, until no peanut butter is visible</li>
                      <li>Freeze once more for 30 minutes and...voil√†!</li>
